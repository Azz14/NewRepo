The script I made shows the Spotify top chart and there respective 
number on said chart 
I chose to continue working with the data i had used in my lab2.2
First clone this repository and input the make command in your terminal c
command line if you already completed the last lab all neccessary files should be downloaded 
the shell scripts will run the data in the csv file already in the repo
the awk code will specify what in the file should be run
