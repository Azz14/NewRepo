I decided to use the spotify chart as my example

I decided to sort the list by names instead of rating on the chart

I am still getting used to Git bash so i put this code
$ sort -t"," -k3 music.csv > art.txt
which allows me to sort the third collumn in the list of the csv file 
and put it in the art.txt file
