This is an example of a SQlite3 database 
My data base is of The Spotify to 100 Streams chart
it is the csv file that i used for the assignment 
i used the sqlite3 code to create a table on the linux server connected 
to the school 
I created a table of Number, Song, Artist, and Streams as collumns and all of 
the coresponding data
